## Custom your own gateway in a few lines
```rust
let cancel = CancellationToken::default();
// create a gateway layer
let gateway = SgGatewayLayer::builder("my gateway")
    .http_routers([
        (
            "some router".to_string(),
            SgHttpRoute::builder()
                .rule(
                    SgHttpRouteRuleLayer::builder()
                        .match_all()
                        .backend(
                            SgHttpBackendLayer::builder()
                            .host("[::]")
                            .port(9003)
                            .build()?
                        )
                        .build()?,
                )
                .build()?,
        ),
    ])
    .build();
let addr = SocketAddr::from_str("[::]:9002")?;
// create a listener
let listener = SgListen::new(addr, gateway.layer(get_http_backend_service()), cancel, "listener");
// start listen
listener.listen().await?;
```



## Why create this project

There are a lot of API gateway products out there, but they are mostly in the form of standalone services. The customization ability is relatively poor, and the cost of using and deploying is relatively high.

This project is based on the ``Rust`` language and uses ``hyper`` as the base network library. The goal is to: **provide a library-first, lightweight, high-performance, cloud-native supported API gateway** .

## 💖 Core functions

* Cloud Native Support, implementing the [Kubernetes Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/gatewayclass/) specification
* Microkernel, plugin-based architecture
* Built-in websocket support
* High performance
* Low resource usage
